	* Task: Use tools like TensorFlow and PyTorch to analyze a machine learning model and identify potential security risks. Write a report detailing the findings and the steps taken to analyze the model.
	* Deliverables: Security analysis report, a written reflection on the experience, and a demonstration of the tools used.

**Internet of Things (IoT) Security:**

1. **Assignment 1:** Conduct a security analysis of an IoT device (20 points)
	* Task: Use tools like Burp Suite and ZAP to analyze an IoT device and identify potential security risks. Write a report detailing the findings and the steps taken to analyze the device.
	* Deliverables: Security analysis report, a written reflection on the experience, and a demonstration of the tools used.
2. **Assignment 2:** Develop a secure communication protocol for IoT devices (20 points)
	* Task: Use a programming language (e.g., C++, Python) to develop a secure communication protocol for IoT devices. Write a report detailing the protocol's security features and the techniques used to develop it.
	* Deliverables: Protocol implementation, a written report detailing the protocol's security features, and a demonstration of the protocol in action.

These assignments are designed to test a wide range of skills and knowledge in the context of cyber security and network administration. They require students to demonstrate their understanding of security concepts, protocols, and tools, as well as their ability to apply this knowledge in practical scenarios.
